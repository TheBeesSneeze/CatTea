  - Jade, what do you think finding Valentine will accomplish?
  - It could help the city. Is that not enough?
  - "It is, but what if he left for a reason? Maybe you can\u2019t find him because
    he doesn\u2019t want to be found."
  - "No. He wouldn\u2019t just abandon this city. He puts all this effort into changing
    it, then he just abandons it out of nowhere? It doesn\u2019t make any sense.
    I need to find out why."
  - "You\u2019re going to be disappointed when you find him, I\u2019m telling you."
  - Maybe. But I still need to know.
  - Okay. Take care, alright?
  - Always.
