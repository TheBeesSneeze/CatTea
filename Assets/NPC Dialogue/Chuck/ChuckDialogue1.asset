  TextList:
  - Hey! What's going on!?
  - What do you mean? What happened?
  - Some idiots from the Crimson Accord decided to drop by my shop and steal the
    prototype.
  - Are you serious?
  - No, I'm joking. They also didn't blow my brains out.
  - What?! You know what, nevermind. Where did they take the gun?
  - I don't know!
  - It's not like they spouted the exact coordinates of their evil plan right before
    shooting me in the head.
  - That would have been very thoughtful, though.
  - "*sigh* Okay. This is a bit of a stretch but it\u2019s the only lead I have. "
  - I heard that a big player in the Accord is hosting a big event about a couple
    miles north of here.
  - It should be easy enough to find him. Just follow the sound of rock and roll
    and the smell of weed.
  - Oh, he sounds wonderful. I'm glad you have such a diverse set of friends.
  - He is NOT my friend! I barely even know him! Just... try not to die, please?
  - Hahaha. Very funny. See ya later alligator.
  - You're hilarious. Bye.
