  TextList:
  - Hey! What's going on!?
  - What do you mean? What happened?
  - Some idiots from the Crimson Accord decided to drop by my shop and steal the
    prototype.
  - Are you serious?
  - "No, of course I\u2019m joking."
  - "And along with not raiding my shop they also didn\u2019t kill me and I totally
    didn\u2019t come back to life."
  - What? Okay, let's just focus on getting the gun back.
  - How did they know about it? Where did they go?
  - Why are you asking me?
  - It's not like they spouted the exact coordinates of their evil plan right before
    shooting me in the head.
  - That would have been nice though.
  - "*sigh* Okay. This is a bit of a stretch but it\u2019s the only lead I have. "
  - I heard down the grapevine that the Accord have been planning on holding an event
    about a mile north of here.
  - Go there and search the area.
  - "That\u2019s it? You\u2019re joking."
  - Yeah, I am. Come on, Jade. I thought you were the smart one here.
  - "I am. I\u2019ll handle it. Thanks for the info."
  - No problem. Try not to die.
  - Hahaha. Very funny. See ya later alligator.
  - You're hilarious. Bye.
