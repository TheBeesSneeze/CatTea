  TextList:
  - Hey! What the fuck is going on!?
  - Huh? What do you mean? What happened?
  - Some Crimson Accord fuckers decided to drop by my shop and steal the prototype.
  - Are you serious?
  - "No, of course I\u2019m joking."
  - "And along with not raiding my shop they also didn\u2019t kill me and I totally
    didn\u2019t come back to life."
  - Can you talk normally for one second and just tell me what happened?
  - '*sigh* I was in my shop working on the prototype. '
  - Some guys from the Crimson Accord came in and said they were looking for your
    prototype.
  - They then proceeded to take the gun and kill me.
  - "I then came back to life in front of this weird fucking machine that had this
    screen with the number 9 on it and my face and I have no idea what\u2019s going
    on."
  - "So my day\u2019s been great. How \u2018bout you?"
  - Ok. I'm just going to ignore the coming back to life thing for now.
  - "Great. Glad the Crimson Accord killing me doesn\u2019t make your top priorities
    list."
  - How did they know about our prototype? Where did they go?
  - Why are you asking me?
  - "It\u2019s not like they walked up to me and started spouting some sort of evil
    monologue about how they knew we were making this and it would be wonderful for
    their evil plan to kill everyone at these exact coordinates before shooting me
    in the head."
  - That would have been nice though.
  - "*sigh* Okay. This is a bit of a stretch but it\u2019s the only lead I have. "
  - I heard down the grapevine that the Accord have been planning on holding some
    sort of event.
  - "I don\u2019t know the exact location of this event, but I think it should be
    somewhere about a mile north from here."
  - I would suggest going there and searching the area.
  - "That\u2019s it? You\u2019re joking."
  - Yeah, I am. Come on, Jade. I thought you were the smart one here.
  - "I am. I\u2019ll handle it. Thanks for the info."
  - No problem. Try not to die.
  - Hahaha. Still ignoring the whole dying thing?
  - "Let\u2019s try to focus on one problem at a time. "
  - Getting that gun back is top priority.
  - We can talk about the whole coming back to life thing when you get back.
  - Fine. See ya later alligator.
  - ...Yeah. Whatever. Bye.
