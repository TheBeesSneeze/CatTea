  TextList:
  - Hey! What the hell is going on!?
  - What do you mean? What happened?
  - 'Some idiots from the Crimson Accord decided to drop by my shop and steal the
    gun.

'
  - Are you serious?
  - No, I'm joking. They also didn't blow my brains out.
  - What?!
  - "Nevermind. Let's focus on the plan. I\u2019m gonna have to start it much sooner
    than I thought."
  - Alright. If I had to guess, it was Fergus who sent the order. But you were going
    to go after him anyway for your plan, right?
  - Yeah. I heard the Crimson has a ton of Frostrite stashed. Him and his goons should
    definitely have some on them.
  - "Mhmm. You\u2019re really convinced the Frostrite will lead you to him, huh?"
  - "It will. He is the only person I can\u2019t sense through it. I hear it whispering.
    There has to be a connection."
  - "Right. I\u2019ll meet you in the ruins after you get the gun back. Just take
    care of yourself out there, alright?"
  - Always. See ya later alligator.
  - "You\u2019re hilarious."
