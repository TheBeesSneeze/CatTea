  TextList:
  - Jade? You mentioned that the Crimson Accord killed you, right?
  - "Yeah, they did. Came to in front of this weird machine that I couldn\u2019t
    make heads or tails of."
  - "Hmmmmmm, yeah, that\u2019s gonna be a problem\u2026"
  - "What\u2019s the problem?"
  - Fergus came back to life.
  - ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
  - Yes. You need to go kill him again. His goons have been very insistent on getting
    that gun back.
  - "You\u2019re paying me extra for this."
  - No.
  - This is worker abuse! I have rights, you know!
  - No.
  - Goddamnit.
