  - Hey! HEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYY!

  - "Oh, what\u2019s that? 200 kilos of weed at the entrance?"
  - What!? Let them in!
  - "Wait, who the bloody hell are you? How\u2019d you get in here?"
  - "Doesn\u2019t matter. The gun. Where is it?"
  - "Gun? Wait a minute\u2026 you\u2019re that punk Jade. I thought my people offed
    you?"
  - "They did. Long story short, I\u2019m back. And I want that gun. Oh, some Frostrite
    would be great too."
  - "That gun doesn\u2019t even bloody work. Put Frostrite in it and everything.
    Bloody waste of time if you ask me."
  - "That\u2019s because it requires a specific piece. Which I still have."
  - "Amazing. I\u2019m surrounded by bloody idiots. Gotta do everything myself, I
    guess. Let\u2019s get this over with."
