  - ALRIGHT BITCHES. NO MONOLOGUES. JUST FIGHTING. COME ON!
  - "Well, don\u2019t you know how to make an entrance! You should join the marketing
    team. We could use someone with your gusto."
  - "Oh, well I\u2019d rather grind myself into a fine powder, but thanks for the
    offer anyway."
  - Ha Ha! I like her! She gets straight to the point, unlike you twats.
  - "Listen, girl. You\u2019re out of your league here. Back off before we have to
    do something you\u2019ll regret."
  - No thanks. Also, cool it with the posturing. It makes you look like an edgy teen
    who just watched some dark, gritty noir and decided that was gonna be their whole
    personality now.
  - '*dark, gritty growl*'
  - "Oh that\u2019s rich coming from you. Anytime I\u2019ve heard you articulate
    something it sounds like a pre-teen who just learned a whole bunch of adult words
    and decided this is what their entire lexicon would now subsist on."
  - "Thanks! You fucking shithead! I bet using all those big, adult words makes you
    feel superior to me, right? Why don\u2019t you just shut the fuck up and let
    me kill you? Please?"
  - "Unfortunetly for you, you won\u2019t be fighting us. We don\u2019t like to get
    our hands dirty, you see, which is why I\u2019ve whipped up this fun little robot
    for you to fight. It even has your eyes!"
  - "Isn\u2019t this like super illegal or something. You definetly didn\u2019t get
    the rights to my image."
  - "We\u2019re the law around here. Enough blathering. Let\u2019s finish this."
