  - "I\u2019m from the Fides. We\u2019ve had a change of plans."
  - "Oh. Where\u2019s Lily?"
  - "She\u2019s been having\u2026issues. We\u2019ve decided it\u2019s best for you
    not to see her anymore."
  - "Recently, we\u2019ve gathered intel that the Yongen have a new leader. Lucius
    Williams. He\u2019s looking to reastablish them as a powerful group. We can\u2019t
