  TextList:
  - "Well, well, well. Look who's made it past my loyal followers. You know, when
    I started this\u2026"
  - "Yeah, yeah, can we skip the whole monologue and just cut to the part where I
    kill you? I\u2019m kinda in a hurry."
  - "Patience, child. Patience is the key to handling a succesful business. That\u2019s
    the number one rule that I followed when I started this endeavor."
  - You cannot just reach for the power whenever you want. The original Yongen knew
    this. Their domination took decades, but it worked.
  - They made Chai the most powerful city in the world, with themselves as the leaders.
  - Of course, having such great power is always a risk. A risk that they were, unfortunately,
    not ready for.
  - "Valentine and his pack of liberals couldn\u2019t possibly understand the immense
    importance of true power."
  - "They\u2019re weak. A bunch of snowflakes jutting around in the wind, waiting
    to land and melt into the earth where they belong."
  - Then, that water will fuel the great uprising. Everyone sees it. Everyone knows
    of the corruption and the lies they spread.
  - "It's time that we burst from the ground and\u2026"
  - "What? And let you rule everything? I bet you couldn\u2019t even convince your
    mother to love you, much less a whole entire nation."
  - "DON\u2019T YOU DARE TALK ABOUT MY MOMMY!"
  - "She was dedicated to the Yongen above everything else, even her own family.
    With your petulance, I would think your mother wasn\u2019t dedicated to anything
    but herself."
  - Oh, she was dedicated! Dedicated to the great consumption of hooch! She would
    drink non-stop all day!
  - It would certainly explain how you turned out like this.
  - "Really? I can\u2019t imagine what your mother did while you were in the womb
    if this is the result we got."
  - ENOUGH! I will not stand this disrespect of mommy any longer! Draw your weapon,
    child, and let us end this.
  - Finally.
