  - Hey, psst.
  - ...?
  - Over here! Quickly, by the bin!
  - I reconize that voice...
  - You miss me?
  - "Lily! You're okay! I thought the fides might have offed you or something\t"
  - Uhhhh, yeah, they still might, actually. Listen. The Fides are after you, alright?
    They know about your resurrecting power.
  - Oh, well I knew that already.
  - Wait, really?
  - "Yeah. They\u2019re an evil corporation that knows everything. It\u2019s pretty
    obvious."
  - "Ok, well, we need to leave the city! It\u2019s not safe."
  - Like, together?
  - "What!? Ummmm, no, not necessarily together. I didn\u2019t mean to say we, that
    was stupid. Just you should leave. It\u2019s dangerous here."
  - "I know that. But it\u2019s not that simple. You see, that gun we were making,
    I was going to use it against the Board of Directors."
  - WHAT?! Are you insane!?
  - "Yeah. Maybe just a little bit. I was hoping that you\u2019d join me, of course."
  - Of course I would!
  - Okay then. All I need is their location, which I was hoping you would know.
  - "I do. Just promise you\u2019ll be careful, alright?"
  - Of course I will! Everything I do is precisely calculated.
  - Right. 100% intentionality at all times.
  - Exactly!
