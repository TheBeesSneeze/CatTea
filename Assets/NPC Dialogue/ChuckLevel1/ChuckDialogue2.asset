  - "You\u2019re back?"
  - Yep. I died.
  - "Okay that\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve said this. What is going on? You
    said you\u2019d tell me later and that\u2019s now."
  - "I was really hoping I\u2019d have a better answer by now, but I don\u2019t.
    I\u2019m sure it has something to do with the Frostrite, though."
  - "Well, if you\u2019re sure, then it must. Did you at least manage to get some
    more of it?"
  - "Uhhhhh, for a little bit. Then I died and lost all of it. And I\u2019m pretty
    sure everyone I killed is back as well. I can sense them through the Frostrite."
  - "You\u2019re serious? This is gonna draw a lot of attention from the Fides, Jade."
  - "I know. I\u2019ll be quick, I promise."
  - "You could also just stop. Stop searching for Valentine. It\u2019s not too late.
    These problems aren\u2019t too big to fix yet."
  - ...
  - "No. I have to find him. I don\u2019t care what it takes. Sorry."
  - "Yeah, that\u2019s what I thought you\u2019d say. Take care."
  - Always.
