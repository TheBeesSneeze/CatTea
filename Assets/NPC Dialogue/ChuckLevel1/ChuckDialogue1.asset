  TextList:
  - Hey! What the hell is going on!?
  - What do you mean? What happened?
  - 'Some idiots from the Crimson Accord decided to drop by my shop and steal the
    gun.

'
  - Are you serious?
  - No, I'm joking. They also killed me.
  - "What?! What do you mean killed you? You\u2019re right here."
  - "Uhhhhh, it\u2019s complicated. I\u2019ll tell you later. Let\u2019s just focus
    on the plan for now. I\u2019m gonna have to start it much sooner than I thought."
  - "Jade, you can\u2019t just-"
  - Ughhh, fine. If I had to guess, it was Fergus who sent the order. But you were
    going to go after him anyway, right?
  - Yeah. I heard the Crimson has a ton of Frostrite stashed. Him and his goons should
    definitely have some on them.
  - "Mhmm. You\u2019re really convinced the Frostrite will lead you to him, huh?"
  - It has to. Why can I sense everyone else in the city with it besides him? There
    has to be something more to it.
  - Right. What happens when you get enough? It just teleports you to his exact location
    or something?
  - "I don\u2019t know! That\u2019s a future me problem. Present me needs to get
    my damn gun back."
  - "Oh, okay, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll figure it out. Listen, meet me in the ruins
    when you find the gun, alright. Wanna make sure it doesn\u2019t blow up in your
    face or anything."
  - Okay, you worrywort.
  - And take care of yourself, alright?
  - Always. See ya later alligator!
  - "You\u2019re hilarious."
