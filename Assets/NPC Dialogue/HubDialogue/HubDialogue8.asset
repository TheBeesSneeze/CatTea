  - Heeeeeeeeeeeeey, pssssssssssssss.
  - Uhhhhhhhhhhh, may I help you?
  - "Oh no, it\u2019s me who\u2019s going to be helping you. I know about your little
    problem, but don\u2019t you worry, I\u2019m not here to blackmail."
  - Who are you, exactly?
  - "Oh don\u2019t you worry about that. I\u2019m just Some Guy."
  - Ok Some Guy, what are you doing?
  - "See, I\u2019ve devised a little system where when you defeat those little guys
    in your way they\u2019ll drop some mighty fine upgrades."
  - If you want to help so much, then why not just give me the upgrades?
  - "Oh ho, well that\u2019s no fun, is it? Isn\u2019t the sense of accomplishment
    you feel after defeating those little guys worth it?"
  - "No, I\u2019d rather just have the upgrades now."
  - "Weeeeeeeeeell suck it up, \u2018cause you're not getting \u2018em now. Anyway,
    Some Guy thanks you for your time today and hopes you enjoy your upgrades."
  - Yeah, thanks, I guess.
