  - AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
  - AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Why are we screaming?
  - "You just appeared there! You weren\u2019t there, then there was a bright flash,
    then you were there. Why?!"
  - "Look, I know about as much as you do, which is to say, nothing. So why don\u2019t

  - "But that\u2019s so unsatisfying."
  - Life is unsatisfying. Besides, I have things to do. Sometimes you gotta just

  - "But I don\u2019t want to! I WANT ANSWERS!"

  - NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
