  - "Ughhh, my head\u2019s killing me."
  - Hello.
  - "Yeah, hi. I\u2019m kinda lost right now. Do you know where we are?"
  - "This is a recording put here for your convenience. You\u2019re probably very
    lost right now."
  - Really? You think so? How am I even alive right now? And where is my gun?
  - "You\u2019re probably wondering how you\u2019re alive and where your gun is.
    Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here to help you out! There is some danger up ahead,
    but I know you\u2019re prepared. You should still have the Frostrite for your
    gun, your energy sword and your quick boots."
  - Oh, I do have the Frostrite. They must have forgotten to take it. How do you
    know all this?
  - The sword is easy! Just use the right click to swing! To use your quick boots,
    just press the spacebar! Easy as pie!
  - What are you talking about? Who are you?! WHAT IS GOING ON?!
  - "I\u2019m sure this cleared up any confusion you may have had. Good luck!"
  - ...
  - I need to find Chuck.
