  TextList:
  - Hello.
  - "Yeah, hi. I\u2019m a little lost right now. Can you tell me where we are?"
  - "This is a recording put here for your convenience. You\u2019re probably very
    lost right now."
  - Really? You think so?
  - "Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here to help you out! There\u2019s some danger up
    ahead, but I know you\u2019re prepared. You should still have your energy sword
    and your quick boots."
  - Wait, how do you-
  - The sword is easy! Just use the right click to swing! To use your quick boots,
    just press the spacebar! Easy as pie!
  - What are you talking about? Who are you?! WHAT IS GOING ON?!
  - "I\u2019m sure this cleared up any confusion you may have had. Good luck!"
  - ...
  - I need to find Chuck.
